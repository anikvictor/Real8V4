                        Interaction sequence:
                <ol>
                            <li>You will get a randomly generated set of 3 questions (e.g., what is your perfect day like, when was the last time you cried and why, what's a regret you have);
</li>
                            <li>The invitee (person who was invited)picks the question you'd like both parties to answer;
</li>
                            <li>The inviter will answer first.
</li>
                            <li>The chat bot (played by a Real8 team member during this data gathering phase) will prompt each of you in how to respond more open-heartedly throughout the interaction
</li>
                        </ol><br />
                This sequence involves asynchronous timing like in texting-- you can take a little time to be thoughtful in your response,but we'd like this interaction to be completed within half an hour. It's like regular texting or emailing except there is a third party facilitrating an interaction that has a structured beginning, middle and end, and you both have the intention of wanting to be more real and get closer.
